# Aberrant-Response-Detector-project
This work aims to detect gibberish or nonsense text in student English test responses. Creating a filtering mechanism will serve the purpose of preventing the automarker from attempting to evaluate gibberish examples. Our training data generally does not contain gibberish, so the automarker may deal with it unpredictably.
